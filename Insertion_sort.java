// insertion sort
// sorted_array = nums[0]
//The first element of unsorted array insert it in its right position
//eg.20,10,40,15,5
//10,20,40,15,5
//10,20,40,15,5
//10,15,20,40,5
//5,10,15,20,50
//it is efficient bcuz if array is already is sorted  then no shifting is involved
//TC for already sorted array is O(N)
